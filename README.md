## Probability based panel performance compared to other non-probability based survey methods.

### Aim:

To compare the quality of the data provided by Life in Australiaâ„¢ panellists when completing the Australian Comparative Study of Survey Methods questionnaire with that of the panellists from four opt-in online panels participating in the same study. A hypothesis is also made that non-probability based panels have worse data quality compared to probability based panels, evidence is needed to support this hypothesis. 

### Data set

This project utilizes data from "The Australian Comparative Study of Survey Method". Due to the sensitive and confidential nature of the information in the data set, it will not be included in this GitHub repository. If you wish to verify the reproducibility of this report, please contact to the Social Research Centre.

### Uses of metrics

Various metrics will be applied to different variables in the dataset in an attempt to identify all careless and insufficiently effort survey respondents in both probability and non-probability based surveys. The presence of a high or low number of careless respondents can be associated with the overall data quality of a survey.

### Result

We will compare the results between probability and non-probability based surveys after applying each metric to the variables. After comparing the result, there is evidence supporting the hypothesis that non-probability based panels have worse data quality compared to probability based panels.
